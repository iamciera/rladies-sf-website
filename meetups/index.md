**Speak**: We are always looking for speakers for upcoming meetups. Come share your R knowledge to our community. All levels are welcome. Topics can include telling us about your job, a cool project, your expertise on an R package, teach a tutorial you wrote, or a unique experiance you had. Reach out to us at ***@rladies.org.

**Host**: We are always interested in having a meetup in a new space, especially to learn about companies in the Bay area and how they use R.  Hosting a R-Ladies event can help you gain exposure in our community, allow us to see your space and culture, and ultimatley increase the diversity of your applicant pool for job openings at your company.
