R-Ladies San Francisco is just one of many chapters of the R-Ladies [Global Organization](https://rladies.org/). You can find us gathering all over the bay area to share our love of data and learning. Come [join us](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-san-francisco/)!

## Global Mission:

**R-Ladies is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote Gender Diversity in the R community**

The R community suffers from an underrepresentation of Women* in every role and area of participation, whether as leaders, package developers, conference speakers, conference participants, educations, or users (see recent  stats ).

As a diversity initiative, R-Ladies’ mission is to achieve proportionate representation by encouraging, inspiring, and empowering the minorities currently underrepresented in the R community. R-Ladies’ primary focus, therefore, is on supporting the R enthusiasts who identify as an underrepresented minority to achieve their programming potential, by building a collaborative global network of R leaders, mentors, learners, and developers to facilitate individual and collective progress worldwide.
